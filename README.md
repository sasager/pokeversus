Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app. (pokemon types)

Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app. (validate names)

Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved).

Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.  Basic math functions don’t count (e.g. addition, etc). (this is the primary function of the website)
